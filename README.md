# Cryptography and Computer Security - CSE 470  
### **Programming Projects 1 & 2**  
**Course Code:** CSE 470  
**Course Name:** Cryptography and Computer Security  
**Delivery Date:** 27.12.2024 17:30  

## **Project Overview**  
This repository contains implementations of cryptographic algorithms as part of the CSE 470 coursework. The project is divided into two parts:

1. **Programming Project 1** - Implementation of **prime number testing algorithms**.
2. **Programming Project 2** - Implementation of **lightweight encryption algorithms and file integrity tools**.

---

## **Programming Project 1: Prime Number Testing**  
Prime numbers play a crucial role in cryptography. This project implements and compares the following prime number testing algorithms:

- **Miller-Rabin Algorithm**  
- **Sieve of Eratosthenes**  
- **Sieve of Atkin**  

### **How It Works**  
- The user can select an algorithm through a simple interface.  
- Each algorithm tests the primality of the given number.  
- The results are compared for accuracy and execution time.

### **Usage**  
Run the program with:  
```sh
python prime_testing.py
